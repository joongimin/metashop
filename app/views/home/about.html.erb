<p class="lead">Dear Hana,</p>
<p>
  It has already been 17 years since I've met you. It was a great privilege for me to be able to grow up together with you throughout the days.<br>
  There were moments of triumphs, moments of disaster, moments of sadness and moments of joy. Throughout every events you have been there for me, and because of that, I can say, with much confidence, that I was happy all the way.
</p>
<p>
  As I said on our wedding day, you still make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.
  <br><br>
  I hope you enjoy this little gift.<br>
  Happy 35th birthday ma petite belle.
